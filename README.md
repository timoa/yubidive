# Yubidive (WIP)

Simple Scuba dive bookings app.

## Project goal

The goal is to make an app that will help Suba clubs to manage their Scuba bookings. More features will come later.

Also, make it runs on a free tier environment like Cloudflare Pages, Vercel or Netlify.

The app is currently based on SvelteKit and TailwindCSS.

> Note: This project is still in (very) early development.
